## UI

- [x] personalize accent color
- [x] caldendar schedule can personalize color

## Logic

- [x] there should be a setting, maybe a setting tab where you can enable an UNBLOCKABLE feature where you cannot toggle the focus button
- [x] the app should manage focus mode via calendar schedule, like a google calendar app
- [x] fix drag - should round to 15m
  - [x] overlay showing time selected?
- [x] integrate with google calendar?
- [ ] modes for focus:
  - [ ] pomodoro:
    - personalize timer: eg 50m focus on 15m off
    - setting to disable calendar, if strict is off
    - free time disable focus even with calendar enabled
