## UI

- [x] personalize accent color
- [x] caldendar schedule can personalize color

## Logic

- [x] there should be a setting, maybe a setting tab where you can enable an UNBLOCKABLE feature where you cannot toggle the focus button
- [x] the app should manage focus mode via calendar schedule, like a google calendar app
- [x] fix drag - should round to 15m
  - [x] overlay showing time selected?
- [x] integrate with google calendar?
- [x] modes for focus:
  - [x] pomodoro:
  - [x] personalize timer: eg 50m focus on 15m off
  - [x] setting to disable calendar, if strict is off
  - [x] free time disable focus even with calendar enabled
- [x] the take a break shouldn't be allowed if it's strict mode, either pomodoro or focus
  - [x] with a break it should pause the pomodoro - then restart it
- [ ] list can add websites from open list?
  - [ ] remove list selection from general ui
  - [ ] focus session should default to the first list - not none
- [ ] add default pomodoro timer - most used ones
- [ ] focus mode should show active list

## Bug

- [x] when first schedule it adds multiple days of the weak instead of the selected. When I schedule once more it behave correctly (select only the day selected)
- [ ] allowd list keep rotating in the ui, why?
