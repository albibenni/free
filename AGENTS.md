This is a macOS blocker app with additional functionalities:

1. Technical Implementation: > Process Monitor
   Browser Extensions: Explain that these are limited to blocking URLs within a specific browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).

2. Core Functionality:
   Blocklists vs. Allowlists: The ability to choose specific 'bad' apps to block or 'good' apps to keep (blocking everything else).
   Lockdown/Strict Mode: A feature that prevents the user from quitting the blocker, changing the system clock, or uninstalling the app until the timer expires.
   Scheduled vs. Pomodoro: Blocking based on a calendar (9 AM–5 PM) vs. a short-term countdown timer.

3. Typical User Workflows:
   Setting a 'Pause' limit (allowing 5-30 minutes of access before re-blocking).
   Using 'Nuclear Options' (where the block cannot be undone even if the computer is restarted).
